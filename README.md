# Serene - AI-Powered Mental Health Chatbot

**Serene** is an innovative mental health chatbot designed to provide personalized support for students and working professionals. Developed for the **Google GenAI Hackathon**, Serene focuses on delivering empathetic, real-time conversations to help users navigate stress, anxiety, and emotional challenges. Our goal is to complement professional mental health services by offering accessible self-help resources.

## üåø Overview

Serene processes user queries with a **hybrid search system** that combines **LangChain** and **ChromaDB** to understand both context and emotion. Powered by **Gemini 1.5 Flash** and the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture, Serene delivers relevant, research-backed responses tailored to users' needs. Additionally, it offers mindfulness exercises, stress management tips, and referrals to professional mental health services when necessary.

## üí° Key Features

- **Personalized Chat Interactions:**  
  Engage in real-time, empathetic conversations tailored to user input and emotional state.
  
- **Context-Aware Responses:**  
  Understands the user's emotional tone and context to provide more accurate, meaningful responses.

- **Robust Knowledge Base:**  
  Pulls from mental health research, expert opinions, and coping strategies to provide reliable support.

- **Mindfulness Exercises & Self-Help Tips:**  
  Offers stress management techniques, breathing exercises, and mindfulness practices to promote well-being.

- **Referrals to Professional Support:**  
  Directs users to professional services when necessary, ensuring a balance between self-help and professional guidance.

## üö´ Out of Scope

- **No Medical Diagnoses or Treatment Plans:**  
  Serene does not provide medical advice, diagnoses, or treatment and is designed to complement, not replace, professional mental health services.

- **Not for Emergency Crises:**  
  Serene does not handle severe mental health crises. Users are directed to emergency services when required.

## üöÄ Challenges We Faced

1. **Library and Dependency Conflicts:**  
   Balancing library versions (Generative AI, LlamaIndex, Langchain, VectorDB) posed challenges. We resolved this by using containerized setups with virtual environments to isolate dependencies.

2. **Emotion Recognition:**  
   Capturing nuances like sarcasm, irony, and subtle emotions was a challenge. We implemented a **multimodal emotion detection** system to enhance accuracy in text-based emotional responses.

3. **Scalability:**  
   Deploying large models on freely available resources required balancing performance with cost-efficiency. We optimized model deployment for scalability with limited global resources.
